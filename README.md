# Html-Css-Demo
This is Elijah Ward's demo site for challenge one of the University of Minnesota Bootcamp!
Finally I'm able to commit and push files into my github repository! This course definately has a big learning curve, however once I get an activity or challenge to work it is very rewarding to see the puzzle complete! Happy coding!
